# Files
The files used in this project only represent a small slice of the total data. Due to file size limitations in github the full data set is not used. The following files are just small slices of the original data file:

- incidents_1.csv
- incidents_2.csv
- incidents_3.csv

Each line of the file represents a reported incident of a crime.

The offense code description file sync/offense_codes.csv is a listing of criminal offenses and associated metadata. Incidents in the data files reference offense codes described in the offense codes file.
